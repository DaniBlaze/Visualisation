Airlines' boarding policies today are not efficient. This report investigates the efficiency of two airline boarding methods, with the purpose of developing an optimal method for how passengers should board a plane. 

\indent\newline
Data was collected from the assignment text, sources online and conversations with the Assistant Duty Manager at Avinor. Three models were constructed and simulated in Anylogic PLE to test the efficiency of each method. Additionally, the simulations were carried out in different scenarios regarding passengers' hand luggage. 

\indent\newline
The main conclusion was that problematic situations related to the storage of luggage and bins occupancy can be minimized, but at the expense of customers' preferences and special condition being neglected.
